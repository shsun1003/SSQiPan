SSQiPan (猴儿棋盘) -- An AI Go game watcher written in C#

(1) Providing a GUI that let you watch AI go programs self-training. At this moment, Leela Zero (C) AutoGTP is included and tested. 
(2) Watch any GTP-supporting AI go programs, such as GnuGO, Leela Zero, playing with each other, or with you!

I started this project only a week ago, which is far from being finished. However, I have a workable executable which I will post here in few days. I will gradually, but without much delaying, complete this project in a couple of months. Eventually, I will also post the full C# code here.
