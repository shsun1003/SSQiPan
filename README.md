SSQiPan (猴儿棋盘) -- An AI go (Weiqi, 围棋) game watcher written in C#

** PLEASE NOTE: The screenshots were likely taken from some older versions. Changes are expected in the newer versions **

(1) Provids a GUI that lets you watch AI go programs self-training on a graphical go board, not in a command window! At this moment, Leela Zero (C) AutoGTP is included and tested. 

(2) Watches any GTP-supporting AI go programs, such as Leela Zero, PhoenixGo, GNUGo, playing with each other, or with you!

(3) Displays the win percentage, as long as the AI go program stream it out, such as Leela Zero does.

(4) More features will be provided down the road, such as save to or load from database, game analyses, problem studies, etc.

The installers will install SS QiPan and some screenshots here may serve as user guide for now. Eventually, I will also post the full C# code here a period of bug-fixing and feature enrichment.
