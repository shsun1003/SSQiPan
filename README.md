SSQiPan (猴儿棋盘) -- An AI go (Weiqi, 围棋) game watcher written in C#

(1) Provids a GUI that lets you watch AI go programs self-training on a graphical go board, not in a command window! At this moment, Leela Zero (C) AutoGTP is included and tested. 

(2) Watches any GTP-supporting AI go programs, such as GnuGO, Leela Zero, playing with each other, or with you!

(3) Displays the win percentage, as long as the AI go program stream it out, such as Leela Zero.

I started this project only a week ago, which is far from being finished. However, I have a workable executable which I will post here in few days. I will gradually, but without much delaying, complete this project in a couple of months. Eventually, I will also post the full C# code here.

In the current phase, I am focusing on the functionality in stead of the beauty of the GUI.
