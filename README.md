SSQiPan (猴儿棋盘) -- An AI go (Weiqi, 围棋) game watcher written in C#

(1) Provids a GUI that lets you watch AI go programs self-training on a graphical go board, not in a command window! At this moment, Leela Zero (C) AutoGTP is included and tested. 

(2) Watches any GTP-supporting AI go programs, such as GnuGO, Leela Zero, playing with each other, or with you!

(3) Displays the win percentage, as long as the AI go program stream it out, such as Leela Zero does.

(4) More feature will be provided down the road, such as game tree navigation, game analyses, problem studies, etc.

I started this project only a couple of weeks ago, which is far from being finished. However, I will post the executables here as beta test while I am working on this projet. Eventually, I will also post the full C# code here.

In the next phase, I will be focusing on the game tree navigation and game analyzing tools.

For now, there is no installation needed. You may just download this project and copy all files in the "Executable" folder, then create a shortcut to the exe file on your desktop. If you like to have image boards (wood or marble), you have to keep all the png files in the same folder.
